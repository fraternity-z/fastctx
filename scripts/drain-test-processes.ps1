.SYNOPSIS
Waits for, then terminates, processes still running from a Cargo target directory.

.DESCRIPTION
Windows cannot replace a binary whose image is mapped by a live process. Contract
tests leave two kinds of short-lived fastctx processes behind on purpose: control
centers riding out their idle window and detached background-job supervisors
finishing their commands. Back-to-back cargo invocations relink the same
target binary within seconds, so without a drain the next test group fails
with os error 5. Runs between test groups on Windows; a no-op elsewhere and
when nothing holds the directory.
